Modified Snakes & Ladder Game for children with autism to enable them recognize the number of tokens in a word. Code is written in C# using Visual Studio Express 2010.

The idea is to replace the dice with pictures of objects(such as animals). 
The child will select one of the picture from the set of objects.
The token (or goti) will move according to the number of characters in the spelling of that object, instead of dice based game. For eg. if child selects the object "tiger" then his token will move by 5 places. 
The selection of a particular object may provide him with ladder or snake or normal move. So he/she needs to cognize the spelling of every object before making his/her move.

This game will therefore help the child to think from images to sound/spelling, which will help the child with autism.
